Aspose.Tasks Cloud is a REST API that can be used with any language: .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, Node.js, Objective C, Android and many more. You can use it with any language or platform that supports REST. (Almost all platforms and languages support REST and provide native REST clients to work with REST APIs). You do not need to worry about language or platform limitations. You can use it with any platform – web, desktop, mobile, and cloud. The API integrates with other cloud services to give you the flexibility you need when processing documents. It is suitable for any type of business, document, or content.
